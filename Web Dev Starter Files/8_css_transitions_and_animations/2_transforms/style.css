/*
    The transform property appiles a 2d or 3d transformation to an element.
    We can rotate, scale, translate, skew, etc...
    rotate - a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point without deforming it.
    scale - a transformation that resizes an element.
    translate - a transformation allows you to move an element from one place to another along an axis.
    skew - a transformation that distorts each point within an element by a certain angle in the horizontal and vertical directions.
