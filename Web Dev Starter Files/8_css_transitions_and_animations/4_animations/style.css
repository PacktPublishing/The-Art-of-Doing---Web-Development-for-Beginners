/*
    Transitions:
        Are generally best for simple from-to movements.
        Can only move from initial to final state, no intermediate steps.
        Can only run once.
        Require a trigger to run (like mouse hover)
        Run forwards when triggered and in reverse when trigger is removed
    Animations:
        Can move from initial to final state, with intermediate steps in between
        Can loop infinitely thanks to animation-iteration-count property
        Can be triggered but can also run automatically
        Can run forwards, in reverse, or alternate directions

    -- The animation code --
    Keyframes are used to control animations.
    You specify animations inside a keyframes rule.
    To get an animation to work, you must then bind the animation to an element.
*/

/* We can use the from and to keywords to control the animation */


/* We can use percentage values.  You can choose any percentage you want */


/* We can change more than one property */


/* 
    With our keyframes created, we will now bind the keyframe by it's name to the animation property of a given element.  
    You must give a the name of the keyframe to use for the animation and the duration.
