<!--
    For our final css project you are tasked with building a website for a club, organization, team, etc...
    Your site should have the following pages:
        An index which serves as a welcome page featuring an animation or transition of some kind.
        A home page that describes the organization.
        A join page that allows users to "join" the organization by submitting their name and email.
        You may add other pages as needed or as you see fit
            - For example, I have "comming soon" pages for news, projects, and members on my example page.
  
    Each page is required to have proper HTML structure and use semantic HTML.
    Each page is required to have the following semantic HTML elements
        A common header across all pages
        A common navigation bar across all pages
        A main section with appropriate use of articles, secitons, divs, and spans
        A common footer across all pages
    
    You will use css to style in a consistent manner across all pages.
        - On my example page, I have two css files, one for the index 'welcome' page whose styling is different.
        - and one for the rest of my site whose stying is consistent across all pages.  
    All styling should be done in the css with no styling done in the html.
    You should try to impliment as many css techniques as you can when appropriate.
