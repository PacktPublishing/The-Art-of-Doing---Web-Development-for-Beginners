/*
    Transitions allow you to change a property value smoothly over a given duration.
    Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. 
    You have to specify two things:  The property to change and the duration.
*/

/* Set the styling for our transition class (our divs) */


/* 
    Give a transition for background color and border radius of 2s 
    You must give a transition property (the name of the css property to which the transition should be applied)
    You must give a transition duration (the duration over which the transition should occur)
*/


/*
    Now that the transition property is set for div1, we will trigger the change when we hover over the div.
    Rather than changing these properties instantaneously, the changes will occur over the duration specified in the transition.
*/


/* Give a transition for margin, shadow, and opacity of 4s */


/* Specify that the transition should occur when we click div2 */


/* Give a transition for transform and background color of 2s */


/* Sepcify that the transition should occur when we hover over div3 */


/* 
    The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
    We can ease (slow start, then fast, slow end).
    We can be linear (same speed start to end).
    We can ease in our ease out (slow start or slow end).
    Lastly we can use cubic-bezier to define our own speed curve.
*/

/* Set the styling for our timing class (our divs) and set a default transition */


/* Target all divs inside our timing_div to set the properties of our transition upon hovering over the larger container div. */


/* Set the timing function of each individual div in the .timing class */


/*
    The cubic bezier curve is based on four points: P0, P1, P2, and P3. 
    P0 is set by default to (0, 0) and P3 is set by default to (1, 1).
    The curve will stretch differently depending on what coordinates you give for points P1 and P2.
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) The values must be between 0 and 1.
