<!-- 
    An anchor tag <a></a> is simply a link to another webpage.
    You must provide an href attribute in the opening tag of the anchor tag.
    href or hyptertext reference is a link to where you will be going to when the anchor tag is clicked.
    This can be an external site, another file in your directory, or a location on your page!
    We can specify locaions on our current pages using the id attribute.

<!--
    When linking to an external site you must provide the url as the href attribute.
    You also must provide text for the link inside the anchor tags.
    We can also use the target attribute to force our browser to open the link in a new tab.
-->


<!-- We can put our links in a list...Really, anything can be a link. -->


<!--
    We can use links to go to different webpages we've created by specifing the pathname.  
    I'm using relative pathnames since they are all in the same directory.
    Lets go and create two new files called page1.html and page2.html
    We will link to them here.

<!--
    We can use links to move to different sections of our page by using the id attribute.
    Recall, we gave our opening h1 an id of top.  
    If we want to link to that id, we need to reference the elements id with a # in our href.
