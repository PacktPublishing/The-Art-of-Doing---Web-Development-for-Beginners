<!--
    All html elements have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
    They are always stated in the start tag of the elmenet and come in name/value pairs:  
    name="value"
-->


<!-- 
    The id attribute provides a specific unique id for an element.  
    You should only have 1 element with a given specific id.
    This will become more important as we get into cascade style sheets.
-->


<!--
    The class attribute provides a way to group common elements together.
    You can have as many elments with the same class as you would like.
    This will become more important as we get into cascade style sheets.
-->


<!--
    Many of these attributes will become cruicial when we begin styling our websites.
    We can use the style attriubte to show some of the basics of styling....
    However, it is bad practice to style inside the html...We will use cascade style sheets!
    DO NOT GET USED TO STYLING IN OUR HTML!
-->


<!--
    We can also use attributes to make our tables look much nicer!
    Again, our styling should be done in a CSS file, 
    but the style attribute is a nice way to learn about html attributes.
