    The image tag is a self closing tag <img>...it doesn't need a closing tag!

    This image is way too big for my liking so we can resize it with the style attribute. 
    We'll use pixels, px to resize.  A pixel is the smallest unit a screen can display.

    It is always good practice to add an alt attribute to your images.
    This is a text representation of what the picture is showing.
    In case someone is visually impared or if your image doesn't load,
    you can still convey meaning with the alternative text.

<!-- We can use images as links! -->


<!--
    We can even add images from other sites.
    In google chrome, right click an image and select 'copy image address'.
    Then paste that address as your src attribute.
    Be careful though of copyright!
