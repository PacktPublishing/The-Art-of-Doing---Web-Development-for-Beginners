/*
    We can access elmenets of the HTML document using the querySelector method.
    While getElementById allos us to select an element based off an id we gave in the HTML,
    querySelector uses the same selector methods as our CSS...
    Which means we can use more complicated selection options.
    When using querySelector, you must use appropriate CSS selction methods such as # and .

/*
    Now that we have access to our main tag
    We can create elements for the document and appened them to our main tag.
*/


// We can alter the text of these new elements using innerText or innerHTML attributes.


// Using query selectors we can grab elements by their id (#).


// We can select elements that are nested

/*
    We can use pseudo classes to target various elements.
    However, note that querySelector will ONLY return the first html element
    That meets the selection criteria!
*/


/*
    To select ALL elements that meet the search criteia we can use querySelectorAll().
    This will return an array we can loop over.
