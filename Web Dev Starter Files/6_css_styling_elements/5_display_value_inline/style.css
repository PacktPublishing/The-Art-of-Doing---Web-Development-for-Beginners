/* 
    Every HTML element has a default display value; block or inline.

    A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full horizontal width available.
    We can specify the width of a block level element and it will take up that full width!
    Commonly used block elements are <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, and  <div>.
    

    An inline-level element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much horizontal width as it needs.
    We cannot specify the width of an inline element as they will only be as wide as needed.
    Commonly used inline elmeents are <button>, <a>, <image>, <input>, and <span>.
    
    We can override the default display value to change the behavoir of the element.

    /* 
        We can add margin to inline elements but we CANNOT set the margin to auto.
        This is because there is no As there is no extra horizontal space available for an inline element 
        margin: auto means "there is no margin" for inline or inline-block elements.
