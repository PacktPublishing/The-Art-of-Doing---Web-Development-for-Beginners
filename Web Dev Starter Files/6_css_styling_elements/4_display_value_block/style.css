/* 
    Every HTML element has a default display value; block, inline or inline-block.

    A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full horizontal width available.
    We can specify the width of a block level element and it will take up that full width!
    Commonly used block elements are <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, and  <div>.
    
    An inline-level element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much horizontal width as it needs.
    We cannot specify the width of an inline element as they will only be as wide as needed.
    Commonly used inline elmeents are <button>, <a>, <image>, <input>, and <span>.
    
    We can override the default display value to change the behavoir of the element.

/*  
    By default, divs are block elements.
    When we override and make them inline, we loose the ability to set the width and height.
    YOU CANNOT SET WIDTH AND HEIGHT FOR INLINE ELEMENTS!  They are only as big as needed!

/*
    We can fix this buy setting the display to inline-block.
    Inline-block elements do not add a line break after the element so elements can sit next to each other.
    They also take up the full available horizontal width; so we can set their width!
