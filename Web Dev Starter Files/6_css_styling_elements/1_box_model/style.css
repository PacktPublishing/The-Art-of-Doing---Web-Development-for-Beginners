/*
    The box model is used when talking about design and layout.
    The box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element.
    It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
    Margin - The space outside the border.  It is transparent.
    Border - A boarder that goes around the padding and content.
    Padding - The space inside the border.  It is transparent.
    Content - The content of the box.  Where text and images appear.
*/

/* 
    Width and height set the width and height of a content area.
    We will do this for ALL divs using the div tag.
    We can set the background color to see the dimensions. 
*/


/*
    Lets alter the box around each div.
    We will style each div differently so lets use the IDs we gave.
    We'll create a border.
    Lets also add some external space using margin and internal space using padding.
    We can target the padding and margin in ALL directions by giving one value.
*/


/* We can target specific parts of the box model using key words top right bottom left. */


/*
    We can target the top/bottom and right/left dimensions by passing two arguments
    top/bottom is first then right/left.
*/


/* 
    We often can define all box properties in one command.  
    For spacing it is top right bottom left. 
    We can also add a box-shadow using horizontal, vertical, blur radius, spread radius and color
*/


/*
    By default width and height are calculated as: 
    element width + padding + border = actual width.
    element height + padding + border = actual height.
    This means when you set the width/height of an element, the element will ofen appear
    larger than you have set because the padding and border are being added to the elements width and height.
    The box-sizing property allows us to include pading and border in an elements total width and height. 
*/


/*
    We can set the margin to auto in order to center the element in the horizontal direction.
    Auto will adjust the spacing on each side so they are equal.
    To do this your element MUST BE A BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENT!  Thankfully, div's are block level elements.
*/


/* We can apply the box model to ANY element, not just divs! */
