<!--
    A table tag <table></table> is another element that is used to organize data.
    Within each table there are table rows indicated by the tag <tr></tr>.
    When working within a table row, we can place a table heading or table data. 
    The table heading tag <th></th> can label the rows, columns, or both with a heading.
    The table data tag <td></td> are the individual squares of the table holding the data.

<!--
    The caption tag <caption></caption> adds information to our table.
    You can also add a <details> and <summary> tag to the caption.  
    This gives the option to add more information in an "interactive" sense.
    We can also put our headers in a column if we would like to change the structure of the table.
