<!-- 
    A tag is a piece of information that describes the data that it is assigned to.
    Tags are specified using angled brackets <>.      
    Most tags have an opening tag <> and closing tag </>.  
    However, some tags are self-closing and only require the opening tag.
    Some common tags inlude heading, paragraph, images, lists, and dividers.

<!-- 
    We can 'mark up' text using various tags.  
    Heading tags are used to add titles to sections.  
    HTML defines six levels of headins h1 through h6.  
    h1 the largest and boldeset text, h6 smallest and least boldest.
    You should only have ONE h1 tag per page!

<!-- 
    We can group text using a paragraph tag.
    Paragraphs are used to add sections of text.  
    Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each paragraph tag.
    However, inside a paragraph tag, whitespace is not accounted for (such as tabs or enter)
