<!--
    This is the final project for this section on HTML.
    You are tasked with using everything you have learned about HTML to build
    an HTML only website.

    This site should include: 
        Organized and semantic HTML including:
            A common header and footer across all pages
            A common navigation bar across all pages
            A main section for each page holding various articles, sections, and more.
            For divs/spans not using semantic HTML a proper class/id should be given.

        Multiple internal webpages appropriately linked together.
        Mutiple external links to outside webpages.
        Multiple links to different sections of a given page.
        
        Multiple and/or appropriate use of headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.
        Multiple and/or appropriate use of text styling tags bold, italics, underline.
        Multiple and/or appropriate use of images, inputs fields, buttons, and forms.
        Multiple and/or appropriate use of divs, spans. 

        Appropriate styling inside our HTML which includes:
            Changing the background color of a given div
            Changing the background color of a given span
            Changing the width and height of a given picture
            You may look up some other styling options..but remember, we will do this in CSS!
