/*
    A function declaration consists of the function keyword, followed by the name of the 
    function, then a list of parameters to the function enclosed in parentheses and separated 
    by commas.

    The function body is enclosed in curly brackets, {} and holds all code to be run
    when the function is called.

    To call a function, simply type the function name and pass the appropriate arguments.

    We can use functions that are part of built in objects, like Math!
    Math.random() will create a float from 0 up to 1.
    We can multiply by any integer to create a random float!
    Math.floor() will return the integer part of any float.
    We can use Math.floor() to turn our random floats into random integers!
