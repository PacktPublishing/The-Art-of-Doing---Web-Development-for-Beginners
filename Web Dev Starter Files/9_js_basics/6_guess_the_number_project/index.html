    In this project you are tasked with building a simple javaScript based 'Guess My Number' game.
    
    When the game begins you first need to gather some information about the given game:
        - How many numbers they would like to guess from.  Ex) 0 to 10, 0 to 50, 0 to 100...0 to anything.
        - How many guesses they would like to have.
        - You should then create a random number with the specified range.  
    This will set the conditions for the game.

    Allow the user to guess and inform them that their guess is either:
        - Too high
        - Too low
        - Correct
    
    Keep track of how many guesses they have taken.  
    If they run out of guesses, inform them that they lost.
    If they got the number correct, inform them that they won!

    Ask the user if they want to play again and allow for continually play until they decide to stop.  

    While this can be done without functions, you should try to move portions of your code into functions.
    My code has two functions that I call inside my "main game loop"
        - getValues() which gets the conditions for a given game and returns them.
        - playGame(gameData) which takes in some gamedata and plays the individual game.
            -gameData is an array that has two values, a secret number and the number of guesses to take.
