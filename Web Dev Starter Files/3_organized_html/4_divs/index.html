<!-- 
    The div (divider or container) tag <div></div> can be used to group content together. 
    This is POWERFUL as it can be used to define a section of html elements.
    We can give a div that is holding element an id or class attribute.
    Later we can target the entire div to style specific setions of content on our website.

        <!-- Here is some ungrouped content. -->
        
        
        <!-- 
            Here is content grouped together inside of a div!
            If this div is unique on our page we can give it an id. 
        -->

        
        <!--
            Divs are block level elements.  
            This means they will take up as much horizontal width as they can.
            They will also always be on new lines.
            We can wrap inline elments inside of a div to place them on a new line.
            There are BETTER ways to do this but for now, this is good to show off divs.

        <!-- Recall images are inline(ish) elements so they will be placed on the same line by default. -->
        
        
        <!-- 
            We can wrap the images in a div to put them on new lines!
            Since these divs are NOT unique we can't give them an id, but should give a class.
