<!-- 
    So far we have learned A LOT about html tags....Which is GREAT!
    But we've been doing EVERYTHING wrong...which is NOT GREAT!
    We have not been following the proper html format.

    Proper html format structure is as follows:
    Always start with a self closing DOCTYPE tag to indicate which verison of HTML we are using.
    Formally, the html tag is the root element of an HTML page.
    The head tag contains all information about the page such as the title.
    The body tag contains all information to be displayed on the page.

    All of our html tags should be inside either the <head> or <body> tags.
