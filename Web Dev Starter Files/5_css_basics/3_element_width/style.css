    Lets set some styling for pixel values. 
    The pixel values are the same size regardless of the parent element (main or div).
    They don't resize as the window changes size.  
    They are absolute!

/*
    Lets set some styling for the percentage values. 
    Both percentage values are 80% but it is a different size depending on the parent element.  
    Our first parent is the main tag so it takes up 80% of that.  
    Our second parent is the parent_div so it takes up 80% of that.  
    As the browser changes size, these elements change size as well as to always maintain 
    80% of the their parent element.  
    They are relative!
*/


/* Lets also style our parent div so we can see it better. */


/* Lets create some image classes to style a small, medium, and large image. */


/* Viewport is a lot like percentage but it allows us to better set the height of our elements. */
