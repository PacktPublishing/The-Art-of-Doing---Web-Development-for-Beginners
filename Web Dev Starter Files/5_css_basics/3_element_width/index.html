<!--
    Many different CSS properties require some measurment of length of size such as width.  
    A length is a numerical value followed by some unit. Lenghts can be absolute or relative.
    Absolute width is fixed no matter the screen size; such as the pixel px.
    Relative width is relative to another length and can vary; such as %.
