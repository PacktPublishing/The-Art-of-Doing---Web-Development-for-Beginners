/*
    There are many different ways we can select elements in css to write rules.
    When using multiple selector methods, 
    rules applied in the most specific selector will take priority.

    Some css properties are inherited from a parent elment while others are not.
*/

/* Universal selector...selects everything. */


/* Element Selector...select all of one element.  Simply use the element name. */


/* Selector List...select multiple elements.  Use element name seperated by commas. */


/* Class Selector....select multiple elements by class.  Use a period and then class name. */


/* ID Selector...select a single element by id.  Use a hashtag and then id name. */


/* 
    Descendant Selector....Select all elements that are inside or descendant's of another
    List elements sepearted by spaces.
*/


/*
    A combination of methods to select all elements inside our our div #my_div.
    This will override any of the previous stylings because our selctor is more specific here.

/* 
    Let's style our footer because we can! It also gives us an opprotunity to talk about inheritence.
    If we try to set the background and color of the footer; it looks like only the color changes!
    The background does not change.

    This is because we are applying styling to a parent element here...the footer.
    What we actully see is the child elemnt...the paragraph.
    Certain css properties are inheritied from a parent while others are not.
    In this example, the color property is inherited from a parent.  The background propterty is not.
*/


/* We have to set the background property of the child to see the change we desire */
