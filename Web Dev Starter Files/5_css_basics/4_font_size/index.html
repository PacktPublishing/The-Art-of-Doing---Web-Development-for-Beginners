<!--
    Many different CSS properties require some measurment of length of size such as font-size.  
    A length is a numerical value followed by some unit. Lenghts can be absolute or relative.
    Absolute font-size is fixed no matter the screen size; such as the pixel px.
    Relative font-size is relative to another length and can vary; such as em, and rem.

            <!-- 
                Font sizes expressed in pixels are absolute.  
                They will not change as the parent element or container changes in size.

            <!--  
                em is sizing that is relative to the font-size of the current parent element.
                2em means 2 times the size of the current parent elements font, 
                .25 means a quarter size of the current parent elements font. 
                So as the parent element font changes size, the size of your elements scales with it.
            -->  
           
    
            <!--
                rem is simliar to em except it doesn't care about the parent element.
                Rather, it cares about the root element of the page. 
                In our case this is the html element of the page.
                So rather than scaling with the div here, it will scale with the html element.
