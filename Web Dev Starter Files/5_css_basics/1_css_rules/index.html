<!-- 
    To add css to our html document we can do so in the <head> tag.
    This is because the style sheet is information ABOUT our website.
    A link tag requires a relationship attribute and an href attribute.
    The relationship to a css is stylesheet.

    Since our focus is now shifted to styling with css I will use minimal
    semantic html....I'll follow always having a header, main, and footer elements
    inside the body tag.

    <head>
        <title></title>
