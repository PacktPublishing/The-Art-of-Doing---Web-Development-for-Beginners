/*
    css works by selecting specific elements on a linked html document and writing rules for that element.
    A css rule needs a selector (element on html) and then the corresponding styling rules.
    A rule requires a property and a value seperated by a colon. 
    Given rules will be applied to all elements within the most specific specification for a selector.
*/

/* This is non-specific rule that will style EVERYTHING within the body tag */


/*
    We can override the body styling rule by selecting an elemenet that is more specific.
    Since the h1/h2 tag is more specific than the body tag, 
    all h1/h2 elements will be styled following these specific rules, not the body rules.
*/


/*
    We can override only a portion of the body rules.
    This time we'll select a more specific tag, h3, but only overwrite certain rules.
    The rules we did not overwrite will follow the rules laid out in our body rules....sometimes :-)
    Note the text will be red here as defined in the body.
*/


/*
    If we don't apply any styling rules to the paragraph tag 
    it will simply follow the styling rules of the body because it is nested inside the body.
    Note, the text will be red.
