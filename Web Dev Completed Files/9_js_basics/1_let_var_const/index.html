<!--
    We can link our javscript (.js) files as a script file in our head tag.
    However, the html will load sequentially top to bottom.  So our .js would load first.
    This could be bad as we might be referencing some html elemnts in our js file
    That have not yet been loaded by the web page!
    We can prevent this by passing the defer attribute.
    This will tell the browser to load all html FIRST, then load the javascript.
