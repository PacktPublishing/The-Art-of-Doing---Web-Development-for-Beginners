<!-- 
    The image tag is a self closing tag <img>...it doesn't need a closing tag!
    The image tag has an attribute you must set - src; the source of the image.
    This can be in our local directory (folder) or from the internet.

<h2>Here is an image of the moon!</h2>
<img src="moon.jpg">
<hr>

<!-- 
    This image is way too big for my liking so we can resize it with the style attribute. 
    We'll use pixels, px to resize.  A pixel is the smallest unit a screen can display.
    We'll learn more about pixels when we discuss css.
-->
<h2>Here is the moon resized!</h2>
<img src="moon.jpg" style="width:200px; height:200px">

<!--
    Changing the width and height of the picture can throw off the aspect ratio of the picture.
-->
<h2>Here is the moon resized with the aspect ratio intact!</h2>
<img src="moon.jpg" style="width:200px;">

<!--
    Changing just the width will keep the aspect ratio of the pictcure and auto adjsut the height.
-->

<!--
    It is always good practice to add an alt attribute to your images.
    This is a text representation of what the picture is showing.
    In case someone is visually impared or if your image doesn't load,
    you can still convey meaning with the alternative text.
-->
<h2>Here is an image that will not load</h2>
<img src="not_real.jpg">
<img src="not_real.jpg" alt="This would be the text to describe our broken image.">

<!-- We can use images as links! -->
<h2>Here the moon is used a link!</h2>
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov">
    <img src="blood_moon.jpg" alt="A moon link to NASA" style="width:200px;">
</a>

<!--
    We can even add images from other sites.
    In google chrome, right click an image and select 'copy image address'.
    Then paste that address as your src attribute.
    Be careful though of copyright!

<h2>Here is an image from an outside website</h2>
