<h2>A Brief History of Pokemon (from wikipedia)</h2>
<p>
    <b>Pokemon</b> (an abbreviation for <i>Pocket Monsters</i> in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise 
    managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. 
    The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered around fictional 
    creatures called "Pokemon." In Pokemon, Pokemon Trainers are people who catch, train, care 
    for, and battle with Pokémon. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch Em All!".
    <u>There are currently 905 Pokémon species</u>.

    The franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as 
    Pokémon Red and Blue), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system 
    that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. 
    Pokémon soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media. 
    Pokémon is estimated to be the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The Pokémon 
    video game series is the third best-selling video game franchise of all time with more than
    440 million copies sold and one billion mobile downloads. The Pokémon video game series 
    spawned an anime television series that has become the most successful video game 
    adaptation of all time with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 192 countries.
    The Pokémon Trading Card Game is the highest-selling trading card game of all time with 
    over 43.2 billion cards sold. In addition, the Pokémon franchise includes the world's 
    top-selling toy brand an anime film series, a live-action film (Detective Pikachu), 
    books, manga comics, music, merchandise, and a temporary theme park. The franchise is also 
    represented in other Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series, where various 
    Pokémon characters are playable.
