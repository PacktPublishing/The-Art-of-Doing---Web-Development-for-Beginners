<!--
    Many different CSS properties require some measurment of length of size such as font-size.  
    A length is a numerical value followed by some unit. Lenghts can be absolute or relative.
    Absolute font-size is fixed no matter the screen size; such as the pixel px.
    Relative font-size is relative to another length and can vary; such as em, and rem.

                em is sizing that is relative to the font-size of the current parent element.
                2em means 2 times the size of the current parent elements font, 
                .25 means a quarter size of the current parent elements font. 
                So as the parent element font changes size, the size of your elements scales with it.
