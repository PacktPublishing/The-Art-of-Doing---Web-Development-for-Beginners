<h1>Mr. Eramo's Love of Pearl Jam</h1>

<p>
    Mr. Eramo's favorite band of all time is <b>Pearl Jam</b>.  He has seen them over 15 times live.
    He listens to all of their studio albums, live albums, and unrealsed material all the time.
    His wife is a fan.  His children are fans.  His siblings are fans.  It is a whole family affair!
    When he was little he can remember buying Pearl Jam's debut album, <u>Ten</u>, on cd,
    putting it into his Sony Discman, putting his headphones on, and being <i>blown away</i>!

<h2>Pearl Jam History (from Wikipedia)</h2>
<p>
    <b>Pearl Jam</b> is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. 
    The band's lineup consists of founding members Jeff Ament (bass guitar), 
    Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), Mike McCready (lead guitar), and Eddie Vedder 
    (lead vocals, guitar), as well as Matt Cameron (drums), who joined in 1998. 
    Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. 
    Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members 
    of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are 
    considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as 
    <u>"the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s"</u>.
</p>

<p>
    Pearl Jam were ranked at number 8 by Rolling Stone magazine in its Top Ten Live Acts of 
    all Time issue. Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and 
    its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the 
    aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it "proved that a rock band which 
    isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every 
    last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of 
    those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame." Eric Weisbard of 
    Spin said in 2001, "The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as 
    organic and principled a rock band as exists." In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, 
    Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time. In April 2006, Pearl Jam 
    was awarded the prize for "Best Live Act" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb 
    called Pearl Jam "the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their 
    last." Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, 
    with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam "toured incessantly and became one of 
    rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with
    marathon, true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of 
    <i>Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2.</i>"

<h2>My Favorite Pearl Jam Lyrics</h2>
<blockquote>
    "You can spend your time along<br>
    Redigesting past regrest oh....<br>
    Or you can come to terms and realize<br>"
    You're the only one who cannot forgive yourself oh...<br>
    It makes much more sense, to live, in the <b>present tense</b><br>"
</blockquote>
<p>-- Eddie Vedder ~ Present Tense</p>

<blockquote>
    "I changed by not changing at all, small town predicts my fate<br>
    Perhaps that's what no one wants to see<br>
    I just want to scream... <u>hello!!!!</u>"<br>
</blockquote>
<p>-- Eddie Vedder ~ Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town</p>
