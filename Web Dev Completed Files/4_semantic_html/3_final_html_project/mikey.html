                <h2>All About Michelangelo</h2>
                <p>Michelangelo, nicknamed Mike or Mikey, is a superhero and one of the four main characters of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics and all related media.[2] Michelangelo is the most naturally skilled of the four brothers but prefers to have a good time rather than train. The youngest of the group, he is shown to be rather immature; he is known for his wisecracks, love of skateboarding, witty optimism, and, like his brothers, love of pizza. He is usually depicted wearing an orange eye mask. His signature weapons are dual nunchaku, though he has also been portrayed using other weapons, such as a grappling hook, manriki-gusari, kusarigama, tonfa, and a three-section staff (in some action figures).</p>
                <p>Michelangelo was given a much bigger role in the 1987 cartoon series and subsequent series and films, directed at a younger audience, than in the more serious Mirage comic books,[3] which were aimed at an older audience, expressing interest in poetry and romancing Horridus. He often coins most of their catchphrases, such as "Cowabunga!" and "Booyakasha!" in the 2012 series. Like all of the brothers, he is named after an Italian Renaissance artist; in this case, he is named after Michelangelo Buonarroti. His name was originally spelled "Michaelangelo" by the original creators, possibly misspelling his namesake's name wrong by confusion with "Michael". In the Mirage comics, all four of the Turtles wear red masks, but to tell them apart, he was given an orange mask instead.</p>
