<!-- 
    The Collectors Project Organized

    This project will be a recreation of your previous Collectors Project.
    This time however you must use proper HTML structure and organization. 
    Tags should be nested inside of a container (div/span) when appropriate.
    Containers should be given a proper class or id attribute.

    Although it is not best practice to style inside of html,
    you will be asked to give all your containers a unique background color using the style attribute
    so we can better see the organization of the containers.  
-->

<!-- 
    Your index page should have the following:
        A 'header' or title section/title banner at the top of your page.
        A log in form with required username, password, submit, and reset buttons. 
        When hitting submit you should be directed to the main.html page.
-->

<!--
    To organize your page, you MUST use proper html structure.
    You MUST also have divs with the following names (id vs class)...
        header
        main
    You decide what content should go in them.
    You can name your other divs as you see fit.   
    Remember, each div should be styled with a different background color.
