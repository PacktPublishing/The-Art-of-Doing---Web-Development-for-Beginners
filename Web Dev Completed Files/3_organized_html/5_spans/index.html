<!-- 
    If a div is a block level container, the span tag <span></span> is an inline container.
    Spans are powerful because we can give them a class or id attribute which we can 
    later target using css to style specific setions of our website. 
    Imagine we wanted to format a section of text in a paragraph with a given background color...

            Here is a paragraph.  Maybe I want to style THIS SECITON A SPECIFIC WAY!
            If I style the whole paragraph, the WHOLE paragraph will be styled the same way.
            This is not the desired result!  How can we style just a section of this text?!?!
       </p>
        
        <!-- We could try to create a div around the section of text...wrong. -->

            Here is a paragraph.  Maybe I want to style 
            <div id="text_wrapper_div" style="background:lightgreen">THIS SECITON A SPECIFIC WAY!</div>
            If I use a div to target that seciton it places the section on a new line and takes up
            the whole of the screen since a div is a block level element.
            This is not the desired result! How can we style just a section of this text?!?!

        <!-- We could use a span (inline container) to wrap the text...correct! -->
        <p>
            Here is a paragraph.  Maybe I want to style 
            <span id="text_wrapper_span" style="background:lightgreen">THIS SECITON A SPECIFIC WAY!</span>
            To do this, I just have to wrap the text in a span.  Even though a paragraph is a block 
            level element, the span is an inline elmeent and it will not create a new line
            and it only takes up the width required.  This is the desired result.
